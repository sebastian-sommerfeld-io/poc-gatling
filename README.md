This project is a proof of concept (PoC) for using [Gatling](https://docs.gatling.io) to load test a web application. The project is a simple web application that is used to learn and familiarize how to write Gatling tests and run them.

## Usage

Everything is controlled through Docker. The `docker-compose.yml` defines linters, starts the system under test (which is a dockerized [Spring PetClinic application](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)) and runs the Gatling tests.

To start every service including linters, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

To start only the Gatling tests and depending services like the system under test, run:

```bash
docker-compose up gatling
```
