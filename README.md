This project is a proof of concept (PoC) for using [Gatling](https://docs.gatling.io) to load test a web application. The project is a simple web application that is used to learn and familiarize how to write Gatling tests and run them.

## Usage

Everything is controlled through Docker. The `docker-compose.yml` defines linters, starts the system under test (which is a dockerized [Spring PetClinic application](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)) and runs the Gatling tests.

To start every service including linters, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

To start only the Gatling tests and depending services like the system under test, run:

```bash
docker-compose up gatling
```

Keep in mind that, when you explicitly start a service by name, all services that it depends on will be started as well but only the log lines from the explicitly named service will be shown.

To easily see the Gatling report, run after the tests have finished:

```bash
docker-compose up gatling-report
```
